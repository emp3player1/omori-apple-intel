Hi! 
To use the patch, simply run this command:
```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DaCUtePotato/omori-apple-intel/master/omori.sh)
```

For manual install, download the repository and run this command:
```
chmod +x path_to_sh_file_in_cloned_repo
```
After that you can drag the sh file into your terminal or enter the path to the sh and press enter.
You have to have Omori on steam for it to work.
**Note that we didn't do much work and most (all) of the credit goes the the devs of the silicon patch Snowp and ynx0! (I forked their repo)**
